![Project Banner Placeholder](https://github.com/sureka2003/Flipkart/blob/main/flipkart.jpg)

Welcome to my SQL project, where I analyze real-time data from **Flipkart**! This project uses a dataset of **20,000+ sales records** and additional tables for payments, products, and shipping data to explore and analyze e-commerce transactions, product sales, and customer interactions. The project aims to solve business problems through SQL queries, helping Flipkart make informed decisions.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates essential SQL skills by analyzing e-commerce data from **Flipkart**, focusing on sales, payments, products, and customer data. Through SQL, we answer critical business questions, uncover trends, and derive actionable insights that help improve business strategies and customer experiences. The project covers different SQL techniques including **Joins**, **Group By**, **Aggregations**, and **Date Functions**.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains code to create the database schema and write queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data representing e-commerce transactions, product details, customer information, and shipping status.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries crafted to solve business problems, each focusing on understanding e-commerce sales and performance.

## Business Problems

The following queries were created to solve specific business questions. Each query is designed to provide insights based on sales, payments, products, and customer data.

### Easy 
1. `Find the most popular product based on total quantity sold in 2023.`
2. `Get the count of returned orders by shipping provider in 2023 `
3. `Show the total revenue generated per month for the year 2023.`
4. `Find the customers who have made the most purchases in a single month.`
5. `Retrieve the number of orders made per product category in 2023 and order by total quantity sold.`
   
### Medium to Hard
1. `Get a list of all customers who have placed orders, including those with no payment records.`
2. `Retrieve products ordered by customers who are in the 'Gujarat' state and whose total order price is greater than 15,000 `
3. `Retrieve the total sales per customer in 'Delhi' where the order status is 'Completed' only include those with total sales greater than 50,000.`
4. ` Show the total quantity sold per product in the 'Accessories' category where the total quantity sold is greater than 50`
5. `Get the top 5 customers by total spending on 'Accessories'`
